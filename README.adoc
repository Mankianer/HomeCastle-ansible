= HomeCastle Ansible Playbooks

This repository provides a modular Ansible setup for bootstrapping and hardening hosts, including automated configuration pulls and security best practices.

== Structure

* `roles/bootstrap_timer`: Sets up a systemd timer for regular `ansible-pull`
* `roles/host_hardening`: Applies security hardening (SSH, UFW, Fail2Ban, unattended-upgrades)
* `site.yml`: Main playbook to orchestrate roles

== Quickstart

. Install required collections:
+
[source,shell]
----
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml
----

. Run the playbook:
+
[source,shell]
----
ansible-playbook -i localhost, site.yml
----

== Requirements

* Ansible >= 2.15
* Ubuntu/Debian system
* `community.general` collection

== ToDo

* [ ] Add CI for linting and testing
* [ ] Add more roles (e.g., monitoring, backup)
* [ ] Improve documentation and usage examples
* [ ] Automate requirements.yml update
* [ ] Add support for more operating systems
